# PacketLossSimulation

To Run, need:
- Simpy
- Python 3.x

Theoretical formula: Calculates the probability that the packet will be loss based off of the arrival rate, the service rate, and the buffer size.
Packet Loss Simulation: Calculates the packet loss based off of the simulation.
This is to compare how accurate the theoretical formula is.
